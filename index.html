Analyzing its spread, prevalence and mortality rates can give us an overview of the trend and damages caused by the disease. Especially in this current pandemic, we realize that the importance of addressing serious health issues is not concentrated to any specific geographical region. All medical and technological advances made by any region has an impact in the trend across the globe. Health is in fact a fundamental universal standard entitled to every human. 
From the static image here, it is evident that TB is a huge health crisis in India followed by China and the Indonesian archipelago. This could be attributed to the fact that these countries have a corresponding high estimated population. Though China has the highest estimated population, the prevalence of TB has been lesser than India.</p><p>In this narrative visualization, we choose to focus on three specific countries. From our data collected between 1990 and 2013, we can see that there has been a significant drop in the prevalence of TB of all forms.<a href="https://public.tableau.com/s/sites/default/files/media/TB_Burden_Country.csv">(Data Source)</a></p><h2 id="united-states-of-america:">United States of America:</h2><p>We use the normalized data to give us a clear picture of the trend of the prevalence of TB of all forms per 100,000 population. This enables us to compare the graphs with other countries which have different population densities. Move the slider to see the jump in TB cases through the years:</p><h3 id="u.s.-tb-prevalence-(1990-2013)">U.S. TB Prevalence (<!-- -->1<!-- -->9<!-- -->9<!-- -->0<!-- -->-<!-- -->2<!-- -->0<!-- -->1<!-- -->3<!-- -->)</h3><p>To understand trends from a global scale we first look at TB in various cases of developed and developing countries. A case of the well-developed is the U.S.
We look at the estimated prevalence of TB of all forms here</p><input type="range" value="1990" min="1990" max="2013" step="1"/><div></div><p>Overall, we see a significant drop in the numbers. It is interesting to see that there has been a spike in the trend only from 1990 to 1991. Since then, the spread has been controlled effectively. After a significant drop, they have maintained a stable trend between 1992 and 1993 which is highly appreciable. Since then, the graph has a steep downward trend. From this visualization, we can see that the awareness and medical advancements to treat TB has been highly effective from the very initial stages especially after reaching a peak in 1991. </p><p>
While we noticed that the spread has been controlled effectively, it is also intuitive to see the damages caused over the stated years. Fortunately, the graph corresponding to the estimated number of deaths due to TB of all forms excluding HIV also show a similar trend. This graph helps us to see the specific trend observed due to TB and not that resulting from a combination of both the deadly diseases. Note that this graph has not been normalized because we would like to observe the trend specific to the region and across the regions. Though it is not a continuous downward trend observed through the years, the mortality rates never exceeded the previous yearâ€™s by large margins and were sometimes controlled to remain the same. This shows effective health care was being provided. </p><h3 id="u.s.-estimated-#-of-deaths-from-tb-:-all-forms,-excluding-hiv-(1990-2013)">U.S. Estimated # of deaths from TB : all forms, excluding HIV (<!-- -->1<!-- -->9<!-- -->9<!-- -->0<!-- -->-<!-- -->2<!-- -->0<!-- -->1<!-- -->3<!-- -->)</h3><p>After seeing the prevalence now we look at the estimated deaths from TB all forms in U.S.</p><input type="range" value="1990" min="1990" max="2013" step="1"/><div></div><h2 id="china:">China:</h2><p>Unlike the trend seen in the United States, China has constantly kept the spread of TB under control over the years and the downward trend is continuous and almost linear. There has never been a year where the spread exceeded the previous years and there was a direct proportion between the drop in the number of cases through the years. This shows that effective preventive measures and treatments were being administered effectively in the region. </p><h3 id="china-tb-prevalence-(1990-2013)">China TB Prevalence (<!-- -->1<!-- -->9<!-- -->9<!-- -->0<!-- -->-<!-- -->2<!-- -->0<!-- -->1<!-- -->3<!-- -->)</h3><p>After seeing a well-developed country statistic of TB we look at a another layer of developed country TB prevalence in another major country, China
What kind of pattern do we observe here and amount of cases.</p><input type="range" value="1990" min="1990" max="2013" step="1"/><div></div><p>Keeping in line with the prevalence graph, the mortality graph also shows a continuous downward trend. Since, the graph is mostly continuous, it is hard to predict when there was an effective medical invention to treat TB or a drastic change in measures where taken. It is intuitive to think that the health care policies and awareness were consistent over the years. </p><h3 id="china-estimated-#-of-deaths-from-tb-:-all-forms,-excluding-hiv-(1990-2013)">China Estimated # of deaths from TB : all forms, excluding HIV (<!-- -->1<!-- -->9<!-- -->9<!-- -->0<!-- -->-<!-- -->2<!-- -->0<!-- -->1<!-- -->3<!-- -->)</h3><p>And now we look at the statistics of estimated deaths from TB for China</p><input type="range" value="1990" min="1990" max="2013" step="1"/><div></div><h3 id="india-tb-prevalence-(1990-2013)">India TB Prevalence (<!-- -->1<!-- -->9<!-- -->9<!-- -->0<!-- -->-<!-- -->2<!-- -->0<!-- -->1<!-- -->3<!-- -->)</h3><p>Deviating from the trend seen in the other two countries, India did not have a steady downward trend from 1990. It was not until 1998 that the spread was minimized. Though the spread never exceeded the previous years, it was maintained at a constant level for over 8 years. It was only between 1998 and 2000 that the trend started showing a decline. It indicates that there could have been effective awareness of the disease until 1998 but it was only later that there was a significant advancement in treatment and health care policy was administered. </p><p>Now we visualize how the prevalence looks at a developing country, India. The trend we are visually seeing is increasing the less developed we go.</p><input type="range" value="1990" min="1990" max="2013" step="1"/><div></div><h3 id="india-estimated-#-of-deaths-from-tb-:-all-forms,-excluding-hiv-(1990-2013)">India Estimated # of deaths from TB : all forms, excluding HIV (<!-- -->1<!-- -->9<!-- -->9<!-- -->0<!-- -->-<!-- -->2<!-- -->0<!-- -->1<!-- -->3<!-- -->)</h3><p>Interestingly, the estimated number of deaths over the years is not correlated with the prevalence graph seen earlier. Though, the above graph shows that the spread was controlled, there was a steady rise in the number of deaths until 2003. This indicates that the spread was not monitored effectively and hence there were many undetected cases of TB patients who died. Only post 2003, the trend of deaths aligns with the spread. </p><input type="range" value="1990" min="1990" max="2013" step="1"/><div></div><p>As we can see the going down the ladder of development in a country we have increased prevalence and # of estimated deaths from TB
From these visualizations, we can see that though there are high-level universal aspects of addressing an epidemic, there needs to be effective regional policies too. The trends seen over the years are an effective indicator of the awareness specific to the region, health care policies and invention/advancements of medical treatments in the region.</p></div></div></div></div>
